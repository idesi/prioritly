# Prioritly

Prioritly is a simple to do list application built using React, Redux, Express & Material UI. 
MongoDb is used as data source. 

##Purpose
The purpose of this side project was to familiarize myself with React ecosystem & Redux. 

###Todo
* Make user interface improvements to the "edit" page
* The priority drop down on the edit page doesn't default to the correct value
* The Is Complete checkbox doesn't work on the edit todo page
* Split out all styles into a separate module
